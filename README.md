## Hi!
I'm Vlad, a chemistry nerd, and a Computer Engineering major at Purdue University. I probably will forget to update this, so you can check out my website ([this one](https://vladbondar.com), or [this one](https://vladb.xyz) for newer details. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions, or want to talk.
